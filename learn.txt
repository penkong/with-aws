which aws service would simplify the migration of a db to aws.???
aws database migration service

create aws acc ,
 

network: cables ,routers , servers

routers : device that forward packets , they know where send data

switch : takes packet and send it to correct server .

pc >> routers >> switch >> receiver

cloud computing : on demand delivery of compute power/ resources

hybrid cloud : some on cloud , some on ours

iaas : provide building blocks for cloud it , networking , computers , datastorage


paas : remove need for your organization to manage the infra
       focus on deploy and managment.


Saas : compledte proudct.


after sign in 
can change your Region 


first service :

IAM


check avai service : on region table



in IAM , we create user and assign them to groups .

create user ,
define password,
set permissions
define group 
admins 
tick that 
next tags
tags : are way to mark a user and add them attributes. 
for example >> Departemnt : Enginnering
review 
create user . 
---> now 
it give us : csv , link to login (changeable) and current state 
on dashboard 
on top 
IAM users sing-in link 
customize 
add name : like priotix (name of root user )
account alias


for sign in :
paste alias
paste username
password


if on navbar you see @ means you are IAM user 
otherwise you are root user .



now you can change policy from root.



on left list of all policies ,


now if click on one policy
it show list of permissions that currently related to that specific policy
json 
{
  effect : allow
  action : valid service or services 
  resource :
}


also can create your own policy 

policy
create policy
choose service 
choose policy
resources
condition


defence mechnism for IAM 
2 way 
password policy
MFA = multi factor authentication
MFA options 
virtual : google, multi (Authy)
U2F : physical , usb
hardware key fob MFA device (Gemalto)
hardware key fob AWS GovCloud (sure pass id)
 


Access way 
consolo 
cli 
sdk 

need to generate Access keys 

users do for themselves

Access key Id 
Access key secret



install aws cli 


aws --version


now create Access key :
go to users 
@user not root
security credentials tab
create Access key 


cli :
aws configure 
ask id 
ask key 
region name : enter
enter

aws iam list-users


IAM roles :
some services for their actions
on our behalf , on our account
they are like users
need permissions
need to assign permissions to services
we use IAM role.
ec2 == virtual server
service + IAM role == create entity
if ec2 want access data 
if permission correct

common roles 
check pdf.


IAM security tools :
IAM credentials report (account lvl)
IAM Access advisor (user lvl)



on bottom left :
select credentials report
download report
 
then 
click users
last tab
Access advisor
it show what we used


Best practices:
dont use root
create user 
create group 
strong pass 
mfa 
create roles 
use access with cli 
take 5 green tick on dashboard



Shared Responsibility Model For IAM :::: it is question of exam 
aws  : infra , config , compliance validation
you : users groups roles policy , mfa , rotate keys , analyze 


IAM DONE !!!!
