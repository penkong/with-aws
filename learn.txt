which aws service would simplify the migration of a db to aws.???
aws database migration service

create aws acc ,
 

network: cables ,routers , servers

routers : device that forward packets , they know where send data

switch : takes packet and send it to correct server .

pc >> routers >> switch >> receiver

cloud computing : on demand delivery of compute power/ resources

hybrid cloud : some on cloud , some on ours

iaas : provide building blocks for cloud it , networking , computers , datastorage


paas : remove need for your organization to manage the infra
       focus on deploy and managment.


Saas : compledte proudct.


after sign in 
can change your Region 


first service :

IAM


check avai service : on region table



in IAM , we create user and assign them to groups .

create user ,
define password,
set permissions
define group 
admins 
tick that 
next tags
tags : are way to mark a user and add them attributes. 
for example >> Departemnt : Enginnering
review 
create user . 
---> now 
it give us : csv , link to login (changeable) and current state 
on dashboard 
on top 
IAM users sing-in link 
customize 
add name : like priotix (name of root user )
account alias


for sign in :
paste alias
paste username
password


if on navbar you see @ means you are IAM user 
otherwise you are root user .



now you can change policy from root.



on left list of all policies ,


now if click on one policy
it show list of permissions that currently related to that specific policy
json 
{
  effect : allow
  action : valid service or services 
  resource :
}


also can create your own policy 

policy
create policy
choose service 
choose policy
resources
condition


defence mechnism for IAM 
2 way 
password policy
MFA = multi factor authentication
MFA options 
virtual : google, multi (Authy)
U2F : physical , usb
hardware key fob MFA device (Gemalto)
hardware key fob AWS GovCloud (sure pass id)
 


Access way 
consolo 
cli 
sdk 

need to generate Access keys 

users do for themselves

Access key Id 
Access key secret



install aws cli 


aws --version


now create Access key :
go to users 
@user not root
security credentials tab
create Access key 


cli :
aws configure 
ask id 
ask key 
region name : enter
enter

aws iam list-users


IAM roles :
some services for their actions
on our behalf , on our account
they are like users
need permissions
need to assign permissions to services
we use IAM role.
ec2 == virtual server
service + IAM role == create entity
if ec2 want access data 
if permission correct

common roles 
check pdf.


IAM security tools :
IAM credentials report (account lvl)
IAM Access advisor (user lvl)



on bottom left :
select credentials report
download report
 
then 
click users
last tab
Access advisor
it show what we used


Best practices:
dont use root
create user 
create group 
strong pass 
mfa 
create roles 
use access with cli 
take 5 green tick on dashboard



Shared Responsibility Model For IAM :::: it is question of exam 
aws  : infra , config , compliance validation
you : users groups roles policy , mfa , rotate keys , analyze 


IAM DONE !!!!

---------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM ---> EC2 (iaas)

EC2 - elstic compute cloud 



control billing :

top right conrenr
click user 
my billing dashboard
need permissionss

login root
my account
search for 
IAM user and role access
edit 
give access.
refresh .

now activated.



SET Budgets :
on right 
go to 
Budgets
create a budget
cost budget
name 
monthly 
recurring
fixed amount
10 dollars
click config
actual cost 
alert threshold 
for example : 80 percent
add email
add more alert if you want 
finally create .



to check what cause price for you :
Billing 
bills 
select priod .




EC2 Basics :

create first website on aws .
check pdf for what ec2 offer.
ec2
ebs = store
elb = load across machine
asg = scaling

EC2 is very important .


choose os 
how much resources ...
how much hardware (ec2 instance store)
how much network( ebs & efs )
network card
firewall rules

there are bootstrap script fot these.


ec2 innstace types 
t2.micro == 750 hrs per month free
 
(((((((((((((( BE < DO < HAVE < SHARE ))))))))))))))

launching ec2 instance :

with ec2 user data 
console
choose region 
type ec2
now 

ec2 console :
on right 
instances 
launch instance
must choose ami (amzon machine image)
we here use quick start
amazon linux2
next 
choose type of instnace 
click 
configure instance details section 
go down 
advanced details 
user data (script will ec2 run)
allow us to use webserver 
ec2-user-data.sh (with apache or go with nginx)
copy paste 
click
add storage 
add tags (like user tage)
name : my first instance
Departemnt : finance 
click 
config security group
it say what we allow in and out
create new security group
add role 
http 
review 
launch
modal open 
create a new key pair 
it give us a pem file (public key)
launch
view 


after loading 



in description 
you will see public ip and dns 



right click on instance 
instance state 
stop




firewall
security groups classic ports :
can reference by IP or security group 
only contain allow rules

create security group around ec2 instance
it will have rules 
inbound / outbound traffic 
ports , ip range



define your ip with port 22 for ssh for example
port 21 = ftp
22 = sftp , ssh for linux 
80 = http
443 = https
3389 = remote desktop protocol for windows
